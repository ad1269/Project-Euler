# Project Euler Solutiong

<h3>Details</h3>
These are my solutions to Project Euler's problems. I started back in February 2016, and work on these problems in my free time.

<h3>Running the Project</h3>
To run the project yourself in BlueJ, go to the BlueJ Project and open package.bluej. To run in any other IDE, just copy everything in Source Files into an existing project.
